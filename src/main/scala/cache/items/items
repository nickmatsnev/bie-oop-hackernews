text The web hosting company IONOS (previously 1&amp;1) had an outage today. I was woken by the call of one of my clients, saying that their website is down. I quickly discovered that all the websites I host there are unreachable. Trying to login to my account, it turns out that the official website ionos.com is unusably slow (like it takes 10 minutes for each page to load, and it doesn&#x27;t load correctly). So I couldn&#x27;t even contact support.<p>Checking their official status page and Twitter accounts, I couldn&#x27;t find any mention of the incident.<p>After more than 2 hours, I was able to reach their customer support via phone call, and they informed me that they are having technical issues, and service will return shortly, which it did.<p>So my issue isn&#x27;t that the outage happened. It is that they reported this issue no where. All their status pages showed no incidents, and that they are fully operational. So basically, I had to spend more than 2 hours answering angry calls from my clients, without being able to tell them what the problem is.<p>Their status page still shows no incidents, 6 hours after the outage.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ionos-status.com&#x2F;

text Recently I&#x27;ve been setting up a private network for myself and I wanted to expose some services over HTTPS. The only reliable method I came up with was to buy a public domain and point its DNS records to private IPs, then I could generate Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificates with a DNS challenge.<p>The downside is that my internal domain names are now public (e.g. you can find them by looking up issued certificates for my domain through https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crt.sh or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.facebook.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;ct&#x2F;, or by looking up the public DNS records).<p>I could keep it all private if I set up my own root certificate, trusted it on all of my machines, and issued self-signed certificates. I could also set up my own DNS server and make all my machines use it. Needless to say, that&#x27;s way more hassle than just making everything public and buying a domain.<p>Another way to keep it private is to issue a wildcard certificate through Let&#x27;s Encrypt and point my DNS records to a reverse proxy which would use the certificate. This would require all network traffic to pass through the proxy, making it a single point of failure.<p>Have you encountered this problem before? Did you solve making your internal DNS private?

text Hey all<p>My name is Adam, and I’m a co-founder at Yotta (YC S20), an app that uses behavioral psychology to help people save money by making saving exciting.<p>We built a feature on Yotta where you can earn 9.62% APY via US Treasury I Bonds. (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.withyotta.com&#x2F;i-bonds)<p>This is an absurd yield for a security that is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government - the strongest guarantee you can get. For comparison, most high-yield savings accounts with FDIC coverage are paying ~2%.<p>The backstory:<p>I Bonds were established by the US Treasury in 1998 to provide returns linked to inflation to protect consumer purchasing power. The rate on I Bonds is determined from the last six months of CPI data and is adjusted twice per year. Inflation is typically around 2% per year, so I Bonds have never been relevant since the rate was never that attractive.<p>Inflation spiked in 2022 driving I Bonds reached a record high yield of 9.62% APY. If you buy them by October 31st, you lock in this rate for six months from the purchase date. In the last 12 months, around $27B has been deposited as a result of the insanely high yield. This compares to $348m in 2020. Note that you have to hold I Bonds for at least a year and you forgo 3 the last three months of earned interest if you redeem before five years. You can deposit a max of $10k into I Bonds per calendar year.<p>So if you can get 9.62% APY on a government backed security when savings accounts are yielding 2%, why doesn’t everyone have I Bonds?<p>A few reasons.<p>1. Most people have never heard of them.<p>2. People don’t want to tie up cash for a year in a CD-like product.<p>3. The only way to buy I Bonds has been on the world’s worst website, Treasury Direct. You have to fill out long forms, click on a virtual keyboard to type your password, can’t use the back button, and make one mistake and you get locked out of your account. The whole thing is a colossal pain in the ass.<p>To solve 1) and 3), we wrapped an easy-to-use UI to buy I Bonds within Yotta. Users opt into Yotta creating a Treasury Direct account on their behalf, and we automate the painful part - interacting with Treasury Direct on the backend. This enables us to provide a great customer experience, making it easy for people to get the 9.62%. If anyone wants to control their Treasury Direct directly without Yotta, they can request it, and we will transfer over their account to no longer be managed by Yotta.<p>Hope you guys check it out and can take advantage of the 9.62% rate before 10&#x2F;31! Note that if you already have a Treasury Direct account, we are unable to support you for I Bonds unfortunately.<p>Happy to answer any questions and looking forward to any feedback.<p>P.S. We were featured in Bloomberg for the launch last week if you want to check that out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2022-09-28&#x2F;buying-i-bonds-there-s-an-easier-way-to-earn-9-62-interest

text tl;dr Please point me to a true beginner’s reference&#x2F;tutorial on networking.<p>Gradually, patiently, persistently, over the past ten years and more, I moved from Windows and Mac to all FOSS apps and then full Linux. Doing the same with my phone. Total success. Independence and self-reliance.<p>In short it’s all about control, privacy, and security, in that order. And: it’s a long term process that requires a commitment.<p>I understand desktop Linux (Ubuntu&#x2F;Pop!_OS) well enough to get myself out of trouble when I mess up or an update breaks. <i>But I have no clue about networking</i>, and I don’t know where to start.<p>Syncthing keeps a handful of my important directories of user-files synced quite reliably.<p>I deleted my Google account years ago. But I’m still in iCloud and iOS for all the photos. Highly recommend Fastmail incidentally.<p>I have a small cheap Linode VPS (doing nothing right now), a Mullvad client on all my devices, Tailscale on all my devices (doing nothing because I don’t understand what it can do), and a Synology NAS in the closet with the modem&#x2F;router (none of which I understand).<p>I want to:<p>- host my own photos and get out of Apple.<p>- host my own bare git repos and not rely on GitHub.<p>- host my own BitWarden server.<p>- host my own Tail-&#x2F;Headscale (whatever the noun is).<p>- follow up on ideas that pop up after I comprehend networking.<p>I can HERPaDERP install packages on client and server, and copypasta configs I don’t understand. Where do I go to <i>understand?</i>

text I am Michael Cao. I am from Viet Nam. I suffered the polio disease and became disabled when i was one year old.<p>When covid 19 pandemic hit the world. All people has suffered a lot. I and my friend, Canadian guy, decided to cofound 2HAC Studio because we thought that we need to do something to help people.<p>We don&#x27;t want to hire any employees to keep the cost at minimum (only spend 9.99$ per year for domain). I keep my job at American company in Viet Nam and my cofounder also still worked at a Bank of Canada. We spent our free time to implement and marketing our products<p>We have been developing the Google workspace addons. Out technology stack are App Script, VueJS  for addons. Hugo for our website. We hosted our website in Google Cloud. Paypal is our payment system. Tawk for customer support. 
All of them are free.<p>At 2020, we had a pain point in Viet Nam because health official requires to do contact tracing when people went to events, churches, schools so we scratched our own itches and developed QR Code Attendance addon <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workspace.google.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;app&#x2F;qr_code_attendance_for_classroom_employe&#x2F;372652717544" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workspace.google.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;app&#x2F;qr_code_attenda...</a> . After that, we provide our addon in G Suite marketplace and a lot of customers used our addon for contact tracing, for example take temperature, name, health status of attendees and give data to health official.<p>Currently, we continue working on QR Code and barcode solutions. Our startup has survived and thrived during Covid-19 while a lot of startups have failed miserable. Our business model are both subscription and lifetime pricing. We have more than 5 million users for all our Google workspace  addons.<p>We make a decent living but we don’t want to risk to give up the main job. Financial recession is coming and a lot of pain is ahead. We highly recommend that most founders should keep the job and reduce spending as much as possible for a while during early stage of their startup.  Also, I would like to encourage disabled people, older people to escape your comfort zone and make changes in the world.  All of us could develop outstanding products with open source or very cheap tools.<p>If you have any questions and feedback, please fell free to contact me and send me an email. Have a great day, everyone.

text I work in video &#x2F; filmmaking &#x2F; ads in London. Most of the work in this space is short form video for YouTube &#x2F; Instagram and TV.<p>Now I am seeing the video generating AI (imagen video from Google on the front page) and I’m 100% sure a good percentage of the work will vanish. There’s loads of work that ad agencies will just hire an AI prompt guy to generate for ads. Big companies will still make ads, of course, but smaller gigs that keep the whole industry afloat? What about even 10 million $ shots with CG characters that will now become commonplace?<p>I’ve retrained before. I started off as an editor, then did VR video, now moved into CG. I’m pretty good at my job - I’ve worked on stuff for Dell and Apple, including stuff you’ve probably seen.<p>It’s funny to think I might have to retrain yet again. I didn’t expect image generation AI to be the next big leap. I was already moving into more storytelling content (ie documentaries) because that’s more defensible against AI. But I expected 3-4 years before video generation would just come out.<p>Now it seems like it’s happening so quickly I’m not sure they won’t have good stuff out in 6 months to a year.<p>So - HN - what do I do now? And what about the other fellas in my industry who will be out of a job? In my estimate, we are talking about tens of thousands.<p>To counter the obvious: I have learnt web dev at one point I thought I’d make the jump, even started learning React but I found the work to be mind numbing. I just love making images. But I feel like Pierre Auguste Renoir’s who was a plate painter in France and did a good living out of it - until the process was industrialised and he struggled (maybe for the rest of his life? I don’t quite recall).<p>To counter the second suggestion: AI prompt design is not image making as far as it would interest me. I also don’t think there will be a huge learning curve. Becoming a filmmaker on my standard requires about 10 years experience or an excellent school (of which there are maybe 10-20 in the world). I would imagine AÍ promoting will be done by the lowest paid interns available.<p>What do I do HN?

text So you moved your apps off Heroku, where did you go to and how has it worked out?<p>Particularly interested in:<p>1. How much work it took to move apps (be honest)<p>2. How much experience you had at the time of the migration - e.g. on one extreme your entire devops experience may consist of just Heroku (that&#x27;s me) or on the other extreme you may be a k8s guru (this helps others gauge how they&#x27;ll go)<p>3. How valuable were your learnings? E.g. replacing Heroku with an IAAS instead of another PAAS might take longer but give more fundamental learnings, and hence be worth it for some<p>4. Cost comparison<p>5. Summary&#x2F;description of your apps (e.g. 20 tiny apps with a few hits per month, 5 medium with ~20k hits per month, 2 large with 1-2m hits per month type thing). Please give language&#x2F;framework.<p>6. Anything else you want to add

text Hi,<p>I built a website on Replit, and would now like to monetize it with subscription. I would like some advice on the best tools for that. Specifically, what I&#x27;m looking for is something that:<p>1. supports multiple tiers of offerings eg free users will get limited views, tier 1 users will get x features, tier 2 users will get x+y features and so forth
2.  allows users to sign in (using email, gmail, etc) so that they can manage their subscription and so that they can access the premium features
3. take payments
4. a professional looking landing site like this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uideck.com&#x2F;templates&#x2F;play-html&#x2F;<p>I looked at multiple solutions:<p>1. Chargebee (but requires an official work email account that I don&#x27;t yet have. it&#x27;s also unclear if it offers a sign in feature)
2. Stripe subscription + customer portal (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;subscriptions and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;customer-management&#x2F;get-started)
3. Squarespace and Wix (but saas apps don&#x27;t seem to be their primary use case)
4. buy a bootstrap framework 
5. Memberful<p>The ideal solution would have the following (in order of priority):<p>1. have all of the features above so that I would need to use only one tool and not multiple
2. easy to integrate &#x2F; as little code as possible
3. Cheap if not free
4. gives me the flexibility to a&#x2F;b test the monetization&#x2F;subscription models eg being able to test when to surface the paywall, pricing, etc<p>Would anyone be able to advice? Thanks in advance.

They then introduce the microkernel concept. Are there microkernel concepts out there (especially code) I can check out? I&#x27;m curious to see how userspace processes communicate to kernel processes to execute privileged actions.

text I have a US PayPal account.<p>When I went to check a $10 Starbucks transaction I had made, I noticed a strange link was there saying &quot;Get more details in your PayPal China account&quot;.<p>I do not have a PayPal China account as far as I know. Even stranger is the link starts with &quot;paypa.cn&#x2F;withdraw&quot;. This does not appear to be a site owned by PayPal.<p>A quick search shows a PayPal community forums post (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paypal-community.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Managing-Account&#x2F;What-does-quot-Get-more-details-in-your-Paypal-China-account&#x2F;td-p&#x2F;2989268), where users that have contacted support are being told that it&#x27;s a &quot;known issue&quot;. Based on the post date this has been there for at least six days.<p>I&#x27;m a bit skeptical though. A bug causing the link to show up when it shouldn&#x27;t, as well as someone forgetting the L in paypal.cn both sounds like things that could happen, but simultaneously? Even then, it seems like they could have fixed this days ago, and should have as potentially sending users and their transaction IDs to a different website seems like a pretty big security issue.

text In the past years I&#x27;ve been quite diluted in my personal and professional life. Changed several jobs, and in my hobbies, I am jumping from one project to another. How do you stay focused? How do you find 1 thing you are really good at and stick with it? Is there a book or a blog teaching this? Although, it seems quite trivial, for me this is a huge live hurdle. Any tips are highly appreciated!

text As a founder without an audience, building great products is no longer enough.<p>It is difficult to find first paying users, grow, and discover where and how to reach them. You have to find the right people through the noise.<p>As a founder who likes to break the rules, I discovered a method.
I unlocked reaching 10.000+ real potential customers as low cost as $50 with 90% successful targeting.<p>Solution: Twitter custom audience lists.
This is the Holy Grail.
you can turn it into a lead generating machine by using custom audience list.<p>Twitter lets you use lists to target.
But there is more important. For this, it does not ask for private information such as e-mail. Only twitter handles (i.e. usernames)
You just need to have a list where you have Twitter handles.<p>If you are willing to take some time, collect the handles (usernames) of your potential customers.
Or use our createtargetaudience.com tool, which searches and lists according to job title or interest written in the profile bio.<p>E.g;
If you have a product for developers, list the people who write developer, software in their profile.
If you have a web3 or NFT community, people who write web3, NFT on their profile.<p>or marketers, designers, founders, no-coders, investors, SaaS, etc.
You can get your list in CSV format.<p>By uploading your list to Twitter ads, you target only the people you want. So no wasted. And you know who you&#x27;re showing the ad to. %90 successful targeting.<p>You will be surprised at the engagement and conversion rate with very low costs. (over 30% for me)
Cost = €5 &#x2F; $6.5 per 1000 impressions.
You can know how much you will spend based on the size of your list.<p>If your target audience includes a job title or interest, it&#x27;s worth a try.

text I have a Google account which used a phone number I no longer have for 2FA. I have the correct password to it, but can&#x27;t login to it without 2FA. Google sends me to an account recovery sequence when I try to regain control over the account, but there&#x27;s actually no way to complete this either without the phone. Of course there&#x27;s no human support available. The only &quot;suggestion&quot; they provide is to create a new Google account, which certainly isn&#x27;t helpful...<p>Screenshot attached. (Email address in that screenshot has been blanked out). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;OT1pqy9<p>To be clear, I still have access to the email address in question and could certainly retrieve any recovery code they send there. They don&#x27;t offer that option though. Phone or nothing.

text I built a classic Macintosh text editor that allows users to do shared bidirection live editing with a web browser on a modern computer. Essentially it allows allows you to really quickly and easily share and edit text snippets on a classic Macintosh. I&#x27;ve tested the software on System 2.0 through System 7.6.1, but it should work on all PPC and 68k Macintoshes running up to MacOS 9.2.2 assuming they have a modem serial port available.<p>In addition to the github repository, I wrote up a blog post here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;henlin.net&#x2F;2022&#x2F;10&#x2F;02&#x2F;Introducing-FocusedEdit-for-classic-Macintosh&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;henlin.net&#x2F;2022&#x2F;10&#x2F;02&#x2F;Introducing-FocusedEdit-for-cl...</a>  outlining how to get up and running. Both the repo and the blog post have a demo gif to help explain exactly what FocusedEdit does as well as how it works.<p>If you have any questions or decide to try it out on your Macintosh or in an emulator, let me know! I&#x27;d love to hear about it!

text Hello HN!<p>I became frustrated with the unpredictible&#x2F;poor match quality and opaqueness of &quot;relevance scores&quot; in existing fuzzy and fulltext search libs, so I tried something different and this is the result. The main selling point is the result quality &#x2F; ordering, with best-in-class memory overhead and excellent performance being bonuses. The API is pretty stable at this point, but looking for feedback before committing to 1.0.<p>TL;DR<p>The test corpus is a 4MB json file with 162k words&#x2F;phrases, so give it a second for initial download. You can also drag&#x2F;drop your own text&#x2F;json corpus into the UI to try it against your own dataset.<p>Live demo&#x2F;compare with a few other libs (there are many more in the codebase, in various states of completion, WIP):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leeoniya.github.io&#x2F;uFuzzy&#x2F;demos&#x2F;compare.html?libs=uFuzzy,fuzzysort,QuickScore,Fuse&amp;search=super%20ma" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leeoniya.github.io&#x2F;uFuzzy&#x2F;demos&#x2F;compare.html?libs=uF...</a><p>In isolation for perf assessment:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leeoniya.github.io&#x2F;uFuzzy&#x2F;demos&#x2F;compare.html?libs=uFuzzy&amp;search=super%20ma" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leeoniya.github.io&#x2F;uFuzzy&#x2F;demos&#x2F;compare.html?libs=uF...</a><p>To increase fuzziness and get broader results, try setting intraMax=1 (core) and enable outOfOrder (userland):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leeoniya.github.io&#x2F;uFuzzy&#x2F;demos&#x2F;compare.html?libs=uFuzzy&amp;outOfOrder&amp;intraMax=1&amp;search=super%20ma" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leeoniya.github.io&#x2F;uFuzzy&#x2F;demos&#x2F;compare.html?libs=uF...</a><p>Also play with the sortPreset selector to swap out the default Array.sort() for one in userland that prioritizes typehead-ness (the resultset remains identical).<p>Still TODO:<p><pre><code>  - Example of stripping diacritics
  - Example of using non-latin charsets
  - Example of prefix-caching to improve typeahead perf even further
  - Example of poor man&#x27;s document search (matching multiple object properties)
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s all, thanks!

text Triggered by the thread on Philip Su I’m wondering about good books and readings on life re-evaluation and new perspectives.
I’m not really feeling burned out, and I’m also not planning to work in an Amazon warehouse, but after long years as leader in big tech I’m feeling this work is so senseless.<p>Thats why I’m looking for readings on purposeful work and changing life.<p>The typical recommendation of „Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance“ isn’t exactly what I’m looking for, but I’m also unable to tell you what exactly I&#x27;m looking for.<p>Any ideas for those perspective changing works?

text It seems like Dalle, MidJourney, or other models would feel much different if they worked as fast as Google images. Not for general use, but is there some office where there is a proof of concept where you can use it at that speed?<p>Even more interesting would be video of someone using it that way.<p>I assume it&#x27;s just a matter of having enough compute.
